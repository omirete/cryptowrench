# Cryptowrench

This is a set of tools that I created to play around with blockchains and cryptocurrencies in general.

Install with:
```
pip -m install cryptowrench
```

Feel free to use it for your own projects.

Although I try my best to make these tools as correct and reliable as possible, `please for the love of dinosaurs` do not rely on them for storing your money. Use a proper wallet for that instead (see: [ethereum.org/en/wallets/](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets), for some wallets). I am however working on implementing a full test suite using publicly available test vectors, which would ensure that the library handles all known edge cases correctly, so be alert for that.

Please create issues/pull requests/feature requests where needed.
